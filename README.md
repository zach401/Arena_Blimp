# Arena_Blimp
Plans for a DIY arena blimp based on a TI MSP430 launchpad. 
The blimp is able to move in 3 dimensions by changing the speed and direction of 3 motors mounted on the blimp. 
Motors and other features of the blimp are controlled remotely via a custom radio control system. 
The blimp also has blue LED lighting which could be used when flying in a dark room.
Most information about this project can be found in the docs folder.

# Code
All code for this project can be found in the Code folder.
Code is broken into two files, one for the microcontroller on the blimp, and one for the microcontroller in the controller.

# Electronic Hardware
A description of the circuit can be seen in the design detial in the docs folder.

# Mechanical Hardware
There are currently no plans for the mechanical porition of this design beyond the pictures included. The gondola is made from styrofoam. 
The envelope is a 2ft diameter latex balloon filled with helium. Weights are added to allow the blimp to reach nuetral boyancy.
